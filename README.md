# Currency Exchanger
#### Banque Misr Technical Task 



✨Hint✨
I started on this task on saturday 19/11/2022 , that's because i don't have enough time due to my work pressure , so i spent that time in building structure of the task and implement the first stroy 
## Features

- Convert currencies from different bases
- All Currencies by using fast forex API [https://www.fastforex.io/] because Fixer API didn't Work With Me

## Structure
- use base api to implement HTTP CLient Methods
- implement fastForexApi to do our http calls 
- Use Class Transformer To Map data From Api Response in our models
- Save All Constants in Constants.ts
- used repository structure and build the repository of FastForexRespository 
- Using BLOC Design Pattern To Communicate between the repository and components 
- What i Implemented doesn't need other ts features like enums or interfaces may it can use in other stories 
- Using Base Component and Inherit in From Converter Component and Other Component [In Future ] to make a usual logic like unsubscribe observable 
- using rxjs in many situations 
- scss styles 
- use some of Angular Material Modules and antd Modules
- Lazy Loading But it have no benefit in this task it will make an effect if the whole stories implemented
- layout module to implement header and layout of the task
